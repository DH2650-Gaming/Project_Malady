						<h2>A Dream of a Little Hero</h2>
						<p>The magical bedtime world of a boy named Bryan</p>
						<p>It was all just a dream—a dream of a little boy named Bryan.</p>
						<p>As night gently fell, Bryan drifted into sleep and entered a world of his own making. His
							familiar bedroom transformed into a land of wonder and adventure. Towers built from blocks,
							castle walls made of pillows, and gates guarded by stuffed animals—all the everyday things
							around him were suddenly filled with magic.</p>
						<p>Adorable, odd little creatures crept out from the corners, not so much enemies as mischievous
							visitors. But in his dream, Bryan was their brave protector. Wrapped in a blanket like a
							cape, dressed in his cozy pajamas, his hair still tousled from sleep—he was a little hero,
							as if returned from a journey to a kingdom among the stars.</p>
						In this dream world, he smiled, ran, and imagined freely—until the morning light peeked through
						the curtains and gently called him back.
						<p>But the dream never truly ends. Because as long as he closes his eyes, the story begins
							again.</p>
